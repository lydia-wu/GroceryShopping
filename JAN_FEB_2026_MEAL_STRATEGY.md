## 📈 Key Success Strategies

### 1. **Stick to the Wednesday Shopping Schedule**
- Every 14 days: Jan 8, Jan 22, Feb 5, Feb 19
- Wednesday morning shopping (10am-12pm) = less crowded
- Route: Costco → H-Mart → Safeway (90 minutes total)

### 2. **Cook Fresh Items First (Days 2-5)**
- Meals B & C use chicken (days 2-3)
- Meal A uses fresh herbs + avocado (day 5)
- This prevents spoilage and waste

### 3. **Utilize Your Freezer**
- **Meal D (Turkey Soup)**: Always freeze half for emergencies
- By end of 3 cycles, you'll have ~4 servings of soup frozen
- Great for busy days or cycle breaks

### 4. **Bulk Item Management**

**You'll Accumulate:**
- Extra eggs: ~180 eggs total (60 per trip × 3)
- Extra pistachios: Great for snacking
- Extra green beans: Versatile side dish
- Frozen Meal D portions: Emergency meals

### 5. **Flexibility Points**

**Built-in Flexibility:**
- Day 8 of each cycle is a rest day
- Day 11+ has ample leftovers
- Between cycles, you can:
  - Eat out for special occasions
  - Use frozen Meal D portions
  - Extend eating leftovers

### 6. **Meal Variety Management**

**Avoiding Meal Fatigue:**
- 6 different meals provides good variety
- Each meal appears every ~2.3 weeks
- You're eating each meal about 3-4 times over 52 days
- Frozen soup portions break monotony
