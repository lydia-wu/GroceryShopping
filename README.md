## 💡 Key Tips & Strategies

#### **Route Optimization**
```
Costco (start) → 15 min drive → H-Mart → 10 min drive → Safeway
Total time: ~90 minutes including shopping
```

**Why This Order?**
1. **Costco first**: Get heavy/bulky items, meat stays cold longer
2. **H-Mart second**: Fresh produce mid-trip
3. **Safeway last**: Lighter items, quick in-and-out

---

#### **Timing Your Trip**

**✅ BEST TIMES:**
- **Weekday mornings** (10am-12pm): All stores less crowded
- **Tuesday/Wednesday**: Fresh restocks, best produce selection

**❌ AVOID:**
- **Saturday 12-4pm**: All stores packed
- **Sunday evenings**: Costco closes early, low stock

---

### 🥬 Freshness Management

#### **Highly Perishable (Use Days 1-5)**
- ⚠️ Chicken breast (Meals B & C)
- ⚠️ Kale (Meals A, B, C)
- ⚠️ Eggplant (Meal B)

- ✅ Frozen peas & carrots
- ✅ Kimchi
- ✅ Pearl barley
- ✅ Pasta
- ✅ Tomato sauce
- ✅ Grapes (last 1-2 weeks)

### 🏠 Homemade Sourdough Planning

You'll need **~2 loaves** over 2 weeks:

- **Day 9**: Bake Loaf #2 (for Meals D & F)

💰 **Savings**: Making your own sourdough saves **$15.32** vs. store-bought!

---

### 📦 Bulk Buying Strategy

#### **You're Buying More Than Needed:**

1. **Ground Turkey**: Buying 4 lbs, need 3.44 lbs
   - **Extra**: 0.56 lbs

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't skip ordering Amazon mackerel early** → Won't arrive in time
❌ **Don't shop on Saturday afternoon** → Too crowded, stressful
❌ **Don't cook Meal F before D** → Turkey may go bad
