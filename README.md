## 💡 Key Tips & Strategies

### 🎯 Shopping Strategy

#### **Route Optimization**
```
Costco (start) → 15 min drive → H-Mart → 10 min drive → Safeway
Total time: ~90 minutes including shopping
```

**Why This Order?**
1. **Costco first**: Get heavy/bulky items, meat stays cold longer
2. **H-Mart second**: Fresh produce mid-trip
3. **Safeway last**: Lighter items, quick in-and-out

---

#### **Timing Your Trip**

**✅ BEST TIMES:**
- **Weekday mornings** (10am-12pm): All stores less crowded
- **Tuesday/Wednesday**: Fresh restocks, best produce selection

**❌ AVOID:**
- **Saturday 12-4pm**: All stores packed
- **Sunday evenings**: Costco closes early, low stock

---

### 🏠 Homemade Sourdough Planning

You'll need **~2 loaves** over 2 weeks:

| Meal | Amount Needed | When |
|------|---------------|------|
| **Meal A** | 1/3 loaf (2 servings) | Days 5-6 |
| **Meal C** | 1/2 loaf (3 servings) | Days 3-4 |
| **Meal D** | 1/2 loaf (3 servings) | Days 10-11 |
| **Meal F** | 1/2 loaf (3 servings) | Days 12-13 |

**Baking Schedule Suggestion:**
- **Day 1**: Bake Loaf #1 (for Meals C & A)
- **Day 9**: Bake Loaf #2 (for Meals D & F)

💰 **Savings**: Making your own sourdough saves **$15.32** vs. store-bought!

---

### 📦 Bulk Buying Strategy

#### **You're Buying More Than Needed:**

1. **Ground Turkey**: Buying 4 lbs, need 3.44 lbs
   - **Extra**: 0.56 lbs
   - **Action**: Freeze for future meals

2. **Pistachios**: Buying 16 oz, need ~4 oz
   - **Extra**: 12 oz
   - **Action**: Healthy snacking!

3. **Eggs**: Buying 60, need 8
   - **Extra**: 52 eggs
   - **Action**: Breakfast for weeks!

4. **Kimchi**: Buying full container, need 1/8
   - **Extra**: 7/8 container
   - **Action**: Keeps for months, great with rice

5. **Green Beans**: Buying full bag, need 1/8
   - **Extra**: 7/8 bag
   - **Action**: Easy side dish anytime
