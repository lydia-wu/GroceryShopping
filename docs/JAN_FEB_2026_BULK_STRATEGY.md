1. Keep in original Costco packaging (vacuum sealed is ideal)
2. Double-wrap in freezer paper or aluminum foil if not vacuum sealed
3. Label with date frozen + "use within 6 months"
4. Lay flat to freeze (stacks better in freezer)
5. Thaw in fridge 24-48 hours before use
6. NEVER refreeze thawed chicken
```

### Ground Turkey Freezing
```
1. Divide into meal-sized portions (1.72 lb each)
2. Use freezer bags, press out all air
3. Flatten into thin rectangles (faster thawing)
4. Label with date + portion size
5. Thaw in fridge 24 hours before use
6. Use within 3-4 months for best quality
```

### Kale Options
```
Option 1: Buy all fresh, use freshest first
  - Rotate bunches, use within 5-7 days each
  - Freeze extras chopped for smoothies

Option 2: Buy half fresh, half frozen
  - Use fresh kale for Meals A, B, C
  - Use frozen kale for Meal F (in sauce, won't notice texture)
