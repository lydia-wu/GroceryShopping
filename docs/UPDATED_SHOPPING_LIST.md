## What's Already in Your Kitchen

From Trip 1, you now have:
- 60 eggs (plenty for all meals + breakfast)
- 3 bunches kale (use within 5-7 days)
- Fresh herbs (dill, parsley - use within 5 days)
- Feta cheese
- Avocados (eat soon or refrigerate)
- Grapefruit (6 count)
- Blueberries
- Tomato paste
- Bread flour for sourdough

### Timing Tip
Since you have the fresh produce from Trip 1, plan to:

2. Use kale within the week while fresh
3. Make sourdough bread with the King Arthur flour

## Next Steps

1. **Make Trip 2** - Focus on meats and remaining pantry items
