## 💰 Budget Strategy

### How We're Staying Under $700

1. **Walmart-First Shopping** - Use Walmart prices (cheapest in your history)
2. **Bulk Buying** - Buy all meat upfront, freeze portions
3. **Skip Expensive Items** - Cut pistachios, pomegranate, fancy items
4. **Reduce Cycles** - Do 3 full cycles (42 days) + simplified days 43-52
5. **Frozen > Fresh** - Use frozen vegetables where possible
6. **Smaller Portions** - Reduce some serving sizes

### The Plan

**3 Full Cycles** (42 days):
- Cycle 1: Jan 8-21
- Cycle 2: Jan 22 - Feb 4
- Cycle 3: Feb 5-18

**Simplified Final Days** (Feb 19-28):
- Use frozen soup portions from previous cycles
- Simple pasta/rice meals
- Eat down pantry/freezer
